# Application Testing
#### Kim Ta: CS350 Data science project 
##

This folder provides images you can test the application with valid inputs. These are fluorescent microscopic images of platelets in blood samples, gathered from a research study on COVID-19 and blood clotting (Pretorius, E., Venter, C., Laubscher, G.J. and et al, 2020).

### Image files and inputs
## 
| Image file name  | Resolution | Seed co-ordinate  | Threshold |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|before1.jpg | 60 | (27,20)  | 0.3 | 
|after1.jpg| 40 | (30,20)  | 0.2  | 
|IM1.jpg | 80 | (10,15)  | 0.4 | 
|IM2.jpg | 30 | (30,30) | 0.2  | 

> The raw R code is also provided in the _SGRraw.Rmd_ file, constraints will need to be manually changed in the code for testing images. 

The resulting region of interest outlined in these images is also provided in this folder.
